# Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Mod

This mod brings fresh content and convenience to Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, adding new blocks, food items, and some quality-of-life tweaks while keeping the classic feel of the original game intact.

## Features

### New Wood Types

Birch and Spruce Logs and Planks: Now you can gather and build with birch and spruce wood alongside the original oak, offering more options for crafting and building without straying from the classic blocky charm.

### New Food Items

Chicken and Mutton: To add variety to your diet, youâ€™ll now find chicken and mutton in the game! These new food options are perfect for keeping your hunger bar up, especially in those early survival days.

### Quality of Life Improvements

Increased Food Stack Limits: Food items now stack up to 64, making it much easier to manage your inventory and keep supplies handy for long adventures.

## Compatibility Warning

Note: Vanilla worlds may not be compatible with this mod due to the addition of new wood types (birch and spruce). Loading a vanilla world could result in missing blocks or other unintended behavior. For the best experience, please start a new world when using this mod.
